## Description 
This is a python server app that monitors a directory and gets all ebooks and pdfs from that directory, and displayes them nicely in a web interface.
You can than navigate through that directory (and sub dirs - same as in Explorer), upload a file to the current directory, or download a file, or download multiple files at once (the entire directory content - as single files)

## Setup
Please change the `BOOKS_DIR` to the ROOT of your books directory.
